# Instructions to test the repository

- Run brownian_motion.m for single robot with normal distribution of steps

- Run brownian_motion_multiple_agents.m for mutiple robots exploring with brownian motion

- Run levy_flight.m for single robot with levy distribution of steps

- Run levy_flight_multiple_agents.m for mutiple robots exploring with levy steps

- Run foraging_brownian_motion.m for mutiple robots exploring with brownian motion and coming back to nest after finding food

- Run foraging_with_APF_brownian.m for single robot exploring with levy flight using APF

- Run foraging_with_APF_multiagent.m for multiple robots exploring with levy flight using APF

- Run foraging_with_voronoi.m for multiple robots running the Lloyd's algorithm, searching within their regions and implement APF on successful exploration
